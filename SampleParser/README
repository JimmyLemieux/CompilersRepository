A JFlex+Cup implementation for the CM programming language.
Note: Some of the code have been taken from Professor Fei Song.

To Build the code:

In order to build the parser type make in the current directory.
This will generate an executable program called "CM".

To test source code like "1.cm", type:

    "java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM 1.cm"

To test the scanner only type:
    "java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Scanner < 1.cm"

In order to display the Syntax Tree type:

    "java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM 1.cm -a"

Test Files:
Some test files are provided with the submission which are 1.cm, 2.cm, 3.cm, 4.cm and 5.cm. Each test file covers different aspect of the program.

Limitations: While many cases are covered in the Parser, there might be some errors that are not caught be our Parser, and this could be improved in the futute.
